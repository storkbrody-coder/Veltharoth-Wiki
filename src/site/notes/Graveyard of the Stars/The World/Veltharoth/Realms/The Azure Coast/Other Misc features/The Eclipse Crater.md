Long ago, there was a battle for the survival of Veltharoth. Multiple Legendary heroes fought to strike down a dark god and huis followers to seal the god  away. The heroes were successful in their attempt sealing part of the gods essence in a large crystal, and sending the rest back where the god came from, leaving it powerless to return. Most of the cultists were either killed or fled from the gruesome scene, but it is rumored that they still linge to this day. Nowadays, the crystal holding the god's essence is sealed away withing a large pristine tower, slowly darkening due to the corruption the god brings.
