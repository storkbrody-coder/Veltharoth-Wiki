Hey, Real quick these ( being pretty much everything to do with the azure coast) are notes for a previous campaign (just the azure coast), feel free to read through everything just remember that this may or may not apply (depending on how I'm feeling about things) since this campaign is set 500 years in the future of the current one, Thanks!

Overview:
The Azure Coast, A region of Veltharoth, sits on the western-most coast of the continent. I is home to part of the Obsidian Steps mountain range as well as the start of the Galewyr(*gal-a-weer*) River. The Azure Coast is a hilly area with many forest and fertile fields, farmed for generations. The waters of  this area are also an unnatural blue hue.
History: 
The Azure Coast has persisted throughout the years as a staple in business, trading & farming. How the region gained it's name is debated with some claiming it was from the color that the noble merchant families used; whilst others claim that it is from the Bluefire Pearl, A semi-common mineral used in jewelry and some basic magic,  causing the water to turn more blue than normal. Over the years The Azure Coast has become more of a trade & religious hub rather than anything else.
The Cities:
	Lumina's Grace: 
		[[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Azure Coast/Towns & Cities/Lumina's Grace/Lumina's Grace\|Lumina's Grace]], named after the goddess [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Gods/Assorted Gods & minor deities/Lumina\|Lumina]], is a major religious capital & trade in the region, with it being at the mouth of the Galewyr river and along the coast itself. Lumina's Grace is home to the largest theocracy in the region (perhaps the whole continent) The Church of Radiance. 
	Sunveil: 
		[[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Azure Coast/Towns & Cities/Sunveil/Sunveil\|Sunveil]] is a landlocked trade city within the azure coast. Sunveil is a major trade city with most major paths and routes passing through it. Sunveil is also home to The Church of the Golden Path.
	Obsidian Rest
		[[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Azure Coast/Towns & Cities/Obsidian Rest/Obsidian Rest\|Obsidian Rest]] is located in the south eastern side of The Azure Coast, next to a dormant volcano.

		A small mountain range on the southern part of the azure coast. It is said that the Crownspire mountains are "Where kings are made".
