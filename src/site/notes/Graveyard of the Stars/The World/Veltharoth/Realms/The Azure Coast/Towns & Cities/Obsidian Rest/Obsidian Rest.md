Obsidian Rest Is a city of the eastern reaches of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Azure Coast/The Azure Coast\|The Azure Coast]] & is home to many mines & craftsmen alike. 
The City was founded after the previous town that stood around the Volcanoes was destroyed.
Just like Lumina's grace & Sunveil, This city has many chain taverns & stores.
Obsidian rest has a unique defense system: The walls will spew lava from the volcanos destroying the land (& possible combatants) in front of them.
Unlike the other cities in the region Obsidian Rest has resisted the Church of Radiance (& may even have a rebellion growing against them..) & instead has a Elected City council running the city.
