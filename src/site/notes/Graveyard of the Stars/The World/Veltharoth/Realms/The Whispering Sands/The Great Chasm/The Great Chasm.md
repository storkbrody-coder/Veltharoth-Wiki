The Great Chasm Is an impossibly deep sea in [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Whispering Sands/The Whispering Sands\|The Whispering Sands]]. No life lives in this region, since this water its incredibly salty, so much that even water based humanoids cannot live in it. It is rumored that the bottom of the chasm leads into the flooded layers of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Dimensions/The Abyss/The Abyss\|The Abyss]].
