Across the lake from [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Cities and Towns/Willowbend/Willowbend\|Willowbend]] sits the Willowbend Rings: a series of ancient stone circles half-submerged in shallow water. Smooth with age and etched with faded runes, the Rings hum faintly at dawn and dusk. Scholars debate whether they are remnants of old magic, a forgotten ritual site, or something still waiting to be used.
