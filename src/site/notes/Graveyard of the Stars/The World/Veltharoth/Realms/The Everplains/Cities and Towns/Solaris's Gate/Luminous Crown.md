The Luminous Crown is a colossal citadel of pale stone and sun-bright metal that straddles the great river at the heart of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Cities and Towns/Solaris's Gate/Solaris's Gate\|Solaris's Gate]]. Its twin foundations rise from opposing banks, joined by a vast central keep that arches over the water like a crown set upon a flowing jewel. By day, its walls gleam with reflected light; by night, embedded solar runes emit a soft, steady glow that outlines its towers against the sky.

Within its depths lie river locks, halls of governance, sanctified chambers, and ancient passages descending below the waterline. From every part of the city, the Crown is visible—an ever-present reminder that the river, and the city itself, are held in balance by what stands above it.


A History of the gate:
The Luminous Crown was raised in the early years of Solaris’s Gate, following the stabilization of the river and the first permanent settlements along its banks. Initial construction took many years, beginning as a fortified bridge and gradually expanding into a true citadel as the city grew around it.

In its early decades, the Crown served primarily as a defensive hold, guarding the crossing and controlling trade along the river. Over time, its purpose shifted. Administrative halls were added, followed by temples, courts, and vaults, transforming the fortress into the political and spiritual heart of the city.

Several times across the centuries, the Crown has been expanded or reinforced after floods, wars, or unexplained structural failures—events officially recorded as natural disasters, though older records suggest otherwise. The deepest portions of the citadel have not been altered in generations, their original builders unknown and their purpose quietly avoided.

Today, the Luminous Crown stands as both symbol and instrument of power. Whoever holds it does not rule Solaris’s Gate outright—but without it, the city cannot function.
