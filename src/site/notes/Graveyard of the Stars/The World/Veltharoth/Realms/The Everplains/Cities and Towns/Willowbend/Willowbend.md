Nestled along the curved shores of a clear freshwater lake, Willowbend is a calm, reflective town known for fishing, boatcraft, and quiet scholarship. Great willow trees drape over the water’s edge, their roots binding the shore against erosion. The town has a reputation as a place where people go to think—or disappear for a while. Located in the northeastern most corner of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/The Everplains\|The Everplains]].
