The Everplains are a vast stretch of fertile lowland where magic lingers quietly in the soil, shaping growth, weather, and life itself. Fields here do not merely grow—they endure. Crops return after fire and flood, grasses bend but rarely die, and even neglected land seems to remember what it once was.

Surrounded by mountains to the north and west, rolling hills to the east, and gradually thinning into savannah toward the south, the Everplains form a natural heartland. Winds move predictably, waters run steady, and the land rewards patience over ambition. This balance has made the region the primary agricultural lifeline of the continent.

Magic in the Everplains is subtle rather than spectacular. It favors cycles, seasons, and quiet persistence. Ancient features—massive roots, fog-choked wetlands, wind-shaped plains, and crown-like hills—hint at forces far older than written history. These forces are not hostile, but neither are they passive.

Despite its abundance, the Everplains are not defenseless. Its geography channels movement, its weather tempers excess, and its people have learned to build with the land rather than against it. Roads follow old growth patterns, fields align with unseen currents, and even borders feel grown rather than drawn.

To outsiders, the Everplains appear peaceful—an endless sea of green under wide skies. Those who know it better understand the truth: this land does not conquer, and it does not yield. It simply waits, growing stronger with every passing season.
