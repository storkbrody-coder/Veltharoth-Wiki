A broad stretch of valley defined by constant, gentle air currents that never seem to cease. The winds here are warm, steady, and oddly directional, shaping grasses into flowing patterns that shift like waves. Weather entering the belt often calms or changes course entirely, and many believe the wind itself is guided by unseen hands. located south of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Cities and Towns/Bloomstead/Bloomstead\|Bloomstead]], and north east of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Cities and Towns/Greenharrow/Greenharrow\|Greenharrow]].
