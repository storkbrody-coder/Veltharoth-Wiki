Goldfurrow is a wealthy agrarian hub built along perfectly straight, ancient furrows that predate the town itself. These lines channel subtle magical energies through the soil, producing grain of exceptional quality. No one remembers who carved the original furrows, but farmers here refuse to plow against them, fearing the land’s quiet reprisal. located in the south eastern part of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Mystic Grasslands/Mystic Grasslands\|Mystic Grasslands]].
