The City of Thistledown is a fortified Fortress city in the grasslands in-between [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/The Everplains\|The Everplains]] and [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Mystic Grasslands/Mystic Grasslands\|Mystic Grasslands]].

Just like the other two cities Thistledown has a Citadel, It is named The Heartspire

Now time for a brief history of the city:
Thistledown was founded as a border fort at a natural crossroads, where open plains narrowed and hostile routes converged. Its earliest incarnation was little more than a ring of earthworks and timber towers, raised in haste to hold ground rather than claim it.

As threats persisted, the fort was rebuilt in stone and expanded outward in four directions, forming the quadrants that define the city today. Each quadrant was designed with a purpose—logistics, trade, labor, and defense—ensuring the city could endure long sieges without relying on outside aid.

At the city’s heart, **the Heartspire** was raised as both command center and final redoubt. From its heights, signals could be seen across all quadrants, and orders could be issued without delay. The citadel became the symbol of unity in a city otherwise divided by walls and drills.

The **Stonewatch** quadrant grew into the city’s martial backbone, housing the barracks, training yards, and armories. Generations of soldiers have passed through its gates, many never leaving the city again except in service. Nearby, **Forging** emerged as a district of smoke and flame, supplying arms, tools, and siegeworks not only for Thistledown, but for allied cities across the region.

Unlike cities that grew rich through trade or culture, Thistledown grew disciplined. Its walls were tested many times—by raiders, monsters, and armies alike—and though portions of the outer boroughs have been lost and rebuilt over the years, the inner city has never fallen.

Today, Thistledown stands less as a city and more as a promise: that the road ends here, and no farther.
