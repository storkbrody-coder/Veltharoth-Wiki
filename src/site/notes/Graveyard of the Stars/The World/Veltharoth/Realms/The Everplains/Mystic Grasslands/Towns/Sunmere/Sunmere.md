Sunmere sits around a shallow, mirror-bright lake that never seems to cool, even at night. The water reflects the sky with unsettling clarity, and locals believe the sun lingers here longer than anywhere else. Solar shrines, sun-dials, and light-focused magic are common, and travelers often report strange dreams after staying too long. Located in the south western part of the  [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Mystic Grasslands/Mystic Grasslands\|Mystic Grasslands]].
