Brightfield is a wide-open farming town where the grass glows faintly gold at dawn and dusk. Crops grow tall and fast, though never without cost—fields must be carefully rotated or they exhaust themselves into ash. The town thrives on abundance but is governed by strict agricultural rites meant to keep the land “awake, but not angered.” Located in the northern [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Mystic Grasslands/Mystic Grasslands\|Mystic Grasslands]].
