Rillwatch is a vigilant river-town built where narrow tributaries (“rills”) feed into a larger waterway. Its stone watchtowers overlook locks, bridges, and floodgates, making it a critical point for monitoring trade, water flow, and threats moving downstream. The townsfolk are known for their discipline and keen eyes—many families have served as wardens, scouts, or river-guards for generations. In times of peace, Rillwatch is quiet and orderly; in times of trouble, it is often the first to know. It is in the north eastern part of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/The Everplains\|The Everplains]].
