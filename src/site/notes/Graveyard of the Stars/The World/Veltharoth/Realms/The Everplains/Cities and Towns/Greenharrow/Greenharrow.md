Now time for a brief history:
Greenharrow began as a seasonal farming camp along the fertile lowlands of the Everplains, settled by families drawn to the unusually rich soil and reliable water. In its earliest years, the settlement had no walls and no name—only furrows cut into the earth and watchfires lit against the dark.

As harvests grew more consistent, storehouses were raised and the first grain roads were cleared. Raids, floods, and famine followed in quick succession, teaching the settlers that abundance without protection invited disaster. A wooden palisade was erected, later replaced by stone, marking the settlement’s transition from camp to city.

Several years later, the **Harrowhold** was constructed  not as a symbol of nobility, but as a place to guard grain, water rights, and labor. With it came the first city guard and the consolidation of land-owning families into a ruling council.

Greenharrow’s importance grew quietly. While larger cities fought wars and built monuments, Greenharrow fed them. Treaties were honored here not out of respect, but necessity. During times of regional scarcity, its gates were reinforced, its stores rationed, and its external boroughs left exposed—decisions remembered long after the hunger passed.

Today, Greenharrow remains steady rather than powerful. Its people measure history not in battles or kings, but in harvests survived, seasons endured, and how often the fields have failed—and been replanted anyway.
