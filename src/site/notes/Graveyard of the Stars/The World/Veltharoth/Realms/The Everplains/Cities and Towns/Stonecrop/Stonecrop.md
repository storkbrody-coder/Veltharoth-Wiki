Stonecrop is a town in the most northwestern corner of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/The Everplains\|The Everplains]]. A rugged agricultural settlement where fields are carved from rocky soil and stone-lined terraces. Stonecrop’s farmers are renowned for making difficult land productive, growing hardy root crops and medicinal herbs. The town has little patience for luxury but deep respect for endurance.
