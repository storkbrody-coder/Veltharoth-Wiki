Brambleford is a town on the western foothills of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/The Everplains\|The Everplains]]. Built around a shallow river crossing choked with thorny hedges, Brambleford is both defensive and stubborn. Thick bramble walls, carefully cultivated rather than cleared, protect the town from raids and beasts alike. Its people are practical, wary of outsiders, and fiercely loyal once trust is earned.
