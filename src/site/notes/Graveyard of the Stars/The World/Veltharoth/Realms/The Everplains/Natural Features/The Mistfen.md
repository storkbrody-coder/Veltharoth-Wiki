The Mistfen is a low-lying wetland perpetually shrouded in pale fog that never fully lifts. The ground is soft, layered with peat and stagnant pools, and sound travels poorly through the haze. Shapes move just beyond sight, and the mist carries whispers that may be wind, memory, or something older stirring in the mire. Located just south of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Cities and Towns/Stonecrop/Stonecrop\|Stonecrop]].
