Hayholt is a town in-between [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Cities and Towns/Cloveridge/Cloveridge\|Cloveridge]] and [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Cities and Towns/Solaris's Gate/Solaris's Gate\|Solaris's Gate]] in [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/The Everplains\|The Everplains]]. A fortified granary-town surrounded by vast wheat fields and windmills. Hayholt exists to store and protect surplus grain, making it a strategic asset during lean years. Its stout walls and watchtowers stand in sharp contrast to the quiet, orderly lives of its residents.
