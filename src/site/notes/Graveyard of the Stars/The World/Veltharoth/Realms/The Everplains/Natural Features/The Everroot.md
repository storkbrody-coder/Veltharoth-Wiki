The Everroot is a vast region where colossal roots—thicker than roads and older than memory—break the surface of the land. Grass, stone, and water bend around them rather than overtake them, as if the roots still live and slowly shift beneath the soil. Magic behaves unpredictably here: growth accelerates, decay stalls, and those who linger too long report a sense of being watched from below. located just north of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Cities and Towns/Solaris's Gate/Solaris's Gate\|Solaris's Gate]].
