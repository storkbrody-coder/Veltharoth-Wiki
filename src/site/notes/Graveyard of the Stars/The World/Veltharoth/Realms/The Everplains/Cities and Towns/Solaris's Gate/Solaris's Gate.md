Solaris's Gate lies at the center of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/The Everplains\|The Everplains]], and spans across The [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Natural Features/Galewyr River\|Galewyr River]]. the city is a vital point for trade since the main citadel spans and blocks the river.
	Solaris's Gate is named after the sun god [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Gods/Assorted Gods & minor deities/Solaris\|Solaris]] due to the sun god "Opening the gate". Before the Everplains were ever settled the land that the city stands on was a catastrophic flood plane, swallowing entire sects of the plains. It is said that one day, at dawn, Solaris himself descended from the heavens and struck the river with a spear of living light, parting and binding the river. And where his light touched the stone of the river bottom, that is where the foundations of the great [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Cities and Towns/Solaris's Gate/Luminous Crown\|Luminous Crown]] lie.
