The Deep North has the start of the Sablerun and The great Crytsalfen Lake within it's boundaries. The region itself is surrounded by a good portion of the Obsidian Steps. Most of the peoples within this region, the elves, remain within the north and do not leave. Those that choose to leave are Excommunicated and forbidden from returning.
