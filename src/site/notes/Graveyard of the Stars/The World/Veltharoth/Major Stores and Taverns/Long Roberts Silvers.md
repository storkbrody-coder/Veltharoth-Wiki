ok, i know I've been making at least semi detailed descriptions / reviews for all of these places, but this is literally a Long John Silvers. Same crappy food, the design is medieval (ofc) but still reminiscent of the design of most LJS. so yeah, i really don't care if you guys actually end up going to one of these, but here it is.








p.s. if you do not end up going to any of these, I'll probably just end up destroying them.
