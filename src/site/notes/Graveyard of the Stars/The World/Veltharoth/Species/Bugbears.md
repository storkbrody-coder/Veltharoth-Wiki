Bugbears are the large hairy Cousins to Goblins. Bugbears are powerful, stealthy, and unnervingly patient. They prefer ambush over battle and intimidation over diplomacy.
Found in forests like those of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/The Everplains\|The Everplains]], and in [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Natural Features/The Underdark\|The Underdark]]
