Contrary To popular belief Goliaths Are the smallest of the Giant species. Most Goliaths only come to around 8ish Feet tall. Goliaths are the most numerous and adaptable of the giant races. Towering over most humanoids, they are still close enough in scale to live alongside smaller folk—though rarely comfortably. Goliaths value endurance, honor, and physical presence, believing survival itself is proof of worth. However In recent years they have been experiencing some prejudice being called "Biggers"
Goliaths are most commonly found in hilly areas such as [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/Kaelorin's Highlands/Kaelorin's Highlands\|Kaelorin's Highlands]], the foothills of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/The Everplains\|The Everplains]], or other high passes.
