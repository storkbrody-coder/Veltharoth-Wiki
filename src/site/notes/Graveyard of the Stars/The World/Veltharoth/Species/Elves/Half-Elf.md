Half-Elves Are just a Cross breed of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Species/Elves/Elves\|Elves]] And [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Species/Humans\|Humans]].
Half-elves are living contradictions—proof that elven isolation is not absolute, and a reminder of choices elves would rather forget. They age faster than elves but slower than humans, often belonging fully to neither world.
