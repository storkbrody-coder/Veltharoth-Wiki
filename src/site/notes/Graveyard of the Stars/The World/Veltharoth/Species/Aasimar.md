Aasimars are winged Humanoids. Aasimar are mortals touched by celestial forces—but **not angels themselves**. Their nature is inherited, not bestowed, and often manifests unpredictably.
They are scattered across the world, though they are drawn to major cities such as [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Cities and Towns/Solaris's Gate/Solaris's Gate\|Solaris's Gate]].
