Orks are a Large humanoid race, that are green and have tusks. Orks are a force of momentum rather than a nation. Their cultures prize strength, dominance, and visible action; to an ork, a thing that cannot defend itself does not deserve to last. Conflict is not cruelty—it is **proof of life**.
Typically found in arid & dry climates, like those of [[The Whispering Sands \|The Whispering Sands ]] and [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]].
