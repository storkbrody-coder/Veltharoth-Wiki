Half Orks are just the children of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Species/Orks/Orks\|Orks]] and [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Species/Humans\|Humans]]. Half-orks live between two worlds that rarely want them. They inherit an ork’s physicality and a humanoid’s adaptability, often becoming problem-solvers, enforcers, or wanderers by necessity. 
They are commonly found in major cities such as [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Cities and Towns/Solaris's Gate/Solaris's Gate\|Solaris's Gate]] or [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Azure Coast/Towns & Cities/Obsidian Rest/Obsidian Rest\|Obsidian Rest]].
