Kobolds are small little lizard creatures. Kobolds are small, fervent, and obsessively devoted to dragons—real or imagined. They believe themselves to be inheritors of draconic destiny, however distant the bloodline may be.
they are found in volcanic regions such as the city of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Azure Coast/Towns & Cities/Obsidian Rest/Obsidian Rest\|Obsidian Rest]], Volcanic tunnels of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Natural Features/The Underdark\|The Underdark]] and ruins.
