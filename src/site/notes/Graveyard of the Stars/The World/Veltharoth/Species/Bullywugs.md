They value comfort, ritual, and shared survival. they are primarily from [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Great Bog/The Great Bog\|The Great Bog]], as well as wetland and river deltas. Though they do venture out to run all of the [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Major Stores and Taverns/Bull-E-Wugs\|Bull-E-Wugs]] stores.
