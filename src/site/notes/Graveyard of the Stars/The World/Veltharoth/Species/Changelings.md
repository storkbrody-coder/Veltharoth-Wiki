they can be found in most major cities, like that of [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/Cities and Towns/Solaris's Gate/Solaris's Gate\|Solaris's Gate]] and [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Azure Coast/Towns & Cities/Lumina's Grace/Lumina's Grace\|Lumina's Grace]].
