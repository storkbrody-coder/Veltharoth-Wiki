 The Krillion are not a people—they are a **presence**. Microscopic, krill-like parasites capable of forming a distributed hive-mind, they infest hosts by replacing higher brain function while preserving motor control and memory.
 Rarely found in the depths near [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/Islands of Note/The Lost Isles/The Lost Isles\|The Lost Isles]] and [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/Islands of Note/Dormun's Jungle/Dormun's Jungle\|Dormun's Jungle]].
