Triton Are Water humanoids that typically lurk in the ocean. Tritions are an ancient aquatic civilization with advanced bio-architecture and strict isolationist doctrine. Unlike surface empires, they do not conquer—they **observe**.
They believe the surface world is unstable and dangerous, and that secrecy is the only path to survival.
Rarely found within Ocean trenches, Reef cities, and Sunken ruins.
