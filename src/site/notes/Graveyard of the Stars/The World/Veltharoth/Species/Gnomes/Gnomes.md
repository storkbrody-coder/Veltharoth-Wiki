Gnomes Are Small humanoid Creatures. Gnomes are curious, inventive, and quietly stubborn. Where others build to last, gnomes build to **understand**.

They also currently have a race war with the [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Species/Elves/Elves\|Elves]]. they can be found anywhere except for [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Deep North/The Deep North\|The Deep North]], mostly in groves in [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Azure Coast/The Azure Coast\|The Azure Coast]], [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/The Everplains\|The Everplains]] and [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/Kaelorin's Highlands/Kaelorin's Highlands\|Kaelorin's Highlands]].
