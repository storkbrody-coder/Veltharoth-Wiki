Deep Gnomes are like [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Species/Gnomes/Gnomes\|Gnomes]], but live in [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Natural Features/The Underdark\|The Underdark]]. Deep gnomes are subtle, clever, and stubbornly alive in a world that should have killed them long ago. They survive not by force, but by being overlooked. Illusion, misdirection, and patience are core to their culture.
typically found in [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Natural Features/The Underdark\|The Underdark]], mostly underneath [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/Kaelorin's Highlands/Kaelorin's Highlands\|Kaelorin's Highlands]] and [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Realms/The Everplains/The Everplains\|The Everplains]].
