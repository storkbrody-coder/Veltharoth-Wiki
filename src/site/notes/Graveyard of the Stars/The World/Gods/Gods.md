Most Gods are divided into 3 Categories, though there are some sub categories.
Primordial Gods: 
	The Primordial Gods are god that have existed since the very universe itself formed, though nobody, not even the gods themselves know how they were formed. There would be **Very Severe** Reprimands if one were to die.
	Examples of these gods include, [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Gods/Moder, Fader & Kin/Moder\|Moder]], [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Gods/Moder, Fader & Kin/Fader\|Fader]], [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Gods/Assorted Gods & minor deities/Lumina\|Lumina]], And [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Gods/Thalorion & Kin/Thalorion\|Thalorion]].
Major Deities:
	A Title Few gods can claim, Usually the children of Primordial Gods. Most of the time Major Deities have large-ish domains, with severe reprimands if one were to die.
	Examples of these gods would be: The Heptarchs Eternal(ex:[[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Gods/Moder, Fader & Kin/Nyzawrath & Kin/Aureon\|Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Gods/Moder, Fader & Kin/Nyzawrath & Kin/Aureon]], [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Gods/Moder, Fader & Kin/Aureon & Kin/Nyzawrath\|Nyzawrath]],[[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Gods/Moder, Fader & Kin/Envaxis & Kin/Envaxis\|Envaxis]]...), [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Gods/Thalorion & Kin/Umberlee\|Umberlee]], & [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Gods/Hearth & Kin/Hearth\|Hearth]].
Minor Deities:
	Lesser Gods, their domains aren't as large or as important withing the world, usually created from belief  by large-ish groups of people. Consequences of these gods dying can vary in severity.
	Examples of these include: [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Gods/Assorted Gods & minor deities/Bry'ar\|Bry'ar]] & [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Gods/Assorted Gods & minor deities/Fleeg\|Fleeg]].
