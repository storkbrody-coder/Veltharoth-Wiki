The semi finals consisted of Trystan Tycho VS Ralf Leigh, & Dalton Warley vs Blase Goldman. Trystan may be a wee bit retarded. and he "knocks out" Ralf winning the match. then Dalton Vs Blase, with Blase sweeping the floor with Dalton. during the Intermission [[Billie\|Billie]] & [[UNKOWN\|UNKOWN]] has "Just water" from the bar, which makes them incredibly drunk. [[Billie\|Billie]] Has been hired to kill the mayor, by the mayor's wife. When the second match starts, its evident that the mayor's guard has stopped paying attention to him, thusly [[Billie\|Billie]] starts making his way to him, noticing this [[UNKOWN\|UNKOWN]] tells a guard who notices [[Billie\|Billie]]. also [[Billie\|Billie]], [[UNKOWN\|UNKOWN]], & [[Rulo\|Rulo]] place bets on blase winning the championship . Blase Ultimately wins, however as he is throwing his final punch, something screeches across the sky, making the strip club portion of the [[Graveyard of the Stars/The World/Veltharoth/Major Stores and Taverns/Bull-E-Wugs\|Bull-E-Wugs]] Collapse. [[UNKOWN\|UNKOWN]]'s Magic field also gets suppressed & Flares up afterwards. In the panic Blase flees & the mayor Sends the three out to go investigate what crashed out in the forest. It takes the group 20 minutes to get out there. when they arrive, a scholar is there studying the impact of a part of the shard fragment. [[Rulo\|Rulo]] has a somewhat *sexual* interaction with him. The party is attacked by some religious zealots & some mutated creatures. [[UNKOWN\|UNKOWN]] throws an object & cracks the shard. Combat shenanigans, [[Billie\|Billie]] touches the shard & effects start to happen, one zealot's mind gets swapped with a squirrels, A boat appears, [[Billie\|Billie]] gains a large amount of knowledge about computer chips, something with [[UNKOWN\|UNKOWN]],idk man, then the zealots and the mutants vanish. [[Billie\|Billie]] runs, the scholar runs, [[Rulo\|Rulo]] starts grabbing shards of the shard & [[UNKOWN\|UNKOWN]] attacks it again, gaining a more powerful antimagic field.  the rock explodes.
